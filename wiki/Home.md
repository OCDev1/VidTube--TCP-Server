## Our Work Process
We started by watching Hemi's videos on Moodle, which helped us build a solid foundation for the project. With that basis, we divided responsibilities for different parts of the project- Eyal handled the sign-in, sign-up, and video upload pages, while Omri was in charge of the watch-video page, and Max took care of the Home page.

After completing our individual tasks, we connected the pages, which initially posed some challenges, particularly in handling the logic behind their connectivity, but we managed to overcome these difficulties.
We then tested the site, fixed any bugs we encountered, and continued testing until the app was stable.

Throughout the process, we used Jira to keep track of our tasks, applying Agile methods just like in the tech industry, which ensured our work remained organized and on schedule.

As we moved on to the server-side development, we watched Hemi's videos to better understand how the server should interact with the client side that we had built earlier. Max focused on the video management, Eyal worked on the user management, and Omri handled video-user interactions such as likes comments etc.

We modified the client side to work with various methods like POST and GET, allowing seamless integration with the server. Finally, we connected a MongoDB database to work with the server, completing the project.
