# Android App Demonstration

### Home Page
The Home page contains many exciting features such as:
- A video list displaying in a random order some of the videos on the platform
- A search bar where you can filter videos by title
- The ability to sign in (or sign up and then sign in) which unlocks more features such as upload a video, edit a video, delete a video, commenting, liking etc.
- Dark mode (in the sidebar), which works across the entire app.

### Watch-Video Page
The Watch-Video Page contains even more great functionality:
- The video itself with Pause, Play, Fullscreen etc.
- Interesting details about the video such as the author, author image, views, how long ago the video was uploaded, the description etc.
- A bottom list with lots of recommended videos for you to watch and enjoy, each better than the last.
- The ability to share your thoughts with buttons such as 'Like', 'Dislike', and 'Subscribe'.
- Clicking the uploaders image or name will take you to his profile page where you can see more videos that he uploaded.
- You can also share your thoughts via the comment section (note: you must be logged in to comment, and comment must contain text) where you can like or 
  dislike other peoples' comments, post a comment on your behalf with your Display name and profile picture, and also delete and edit comments (again, 
  you must be logged in to comment, edit and delete).
